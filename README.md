Colab notebooks with code and learnings from the book Deep Learning with Pytorch by Stevens, Antiga, Viehman

The work here is my journey through the book, Deep Learning with Pytorch, by Stevens, Antiga, Viehman. Manning publicaitons. 
The code here, largely already exists in the book and can be downloaded from the official repository as well. 
I have included my thoughts, observations, commentary as well as played around with the code for my learning. 
I hope that this may help someone else wading through the same book. 

You'd need a google colab account to run the notebooks here.
